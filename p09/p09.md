Portfolio 9 Dot-and-Whisker Plot

People use multiple regression all the time. I always had a hard time
plotting regression results and did not know another way to report it
besides using tables. Then I discovered the Dot-and-Whisker Plot. The
plot below shows

The dots are the estimates, the lines indicate 95% confidence intervals.
It might be easy to use covid-death percentages as an example. We can
see death% predicts fear of covid but not the other 2 outcomes because
the range includes 0. Obviously there are still problems. I wish the
lines and dots could be thicker. I also hope that I can plot the
standardized coefficients so the death% doesnâ€™t look so dramatic.

``` r
reg <- reg[complete.cases(reg[ , c('case_p', 'death_p')]), ]


case_p.z <- (reg$case_p - mean(reg$case_p)) / sd(reg$case_p)

death_p.z <- (reg$death_p - mean(reg$death_p)) / sd(reg$death_p)

cv13.z <- (reg$cv13 - mean(reg$cv13)) / sd(reg$cv13)

risk_r.z <- (reg$risk_r - mean(reg$risk_r)) / sd(reg$risk_r)

covrac.z <- (reg$covrac - mean(reg$covrac)) / sd(reg$covrac)

fe.z <- (reg$fe - mean(reg$fe)) / sd(reg$fe)

dis.z <- (reg$dis - mean(reg$dis)) / sd(reg$dis)

psyh.z <- (reg$psyh - mean(reg$psyh)) / sd(reg$psyh)
```

``` r
fear.z <- lm(fe.z ~ case_p.z + death_p.z + cv13.z + risk_r.z + covrac.z, data = reg)

I prefer the dotwhisker package to the jtools only because it provides
more customization. For example, here i cannot really change the whisker
size or dot shape. But given that both of these plotting functions are
based on ggplot2, so if I created the plots in ggplot2, it might provide
the optimal customization.
