``` r

I found a cool package that can visualize power as long as you provide
the testing statistics and df. The red curve shows the null hypothesis,
whereas the blue curve shows the alternative hypothesis. I wish I could
change the legend theme, but I tried the code that works for ggplot
won’t work for this plot.

``` r
power.t.test(ncp = -2.6589, df = 179.97, alpha = 0.05, alternative = "not equal") 
```

    ##      power ncp.alt ncp.null alpha     df  t.crit.1 t.crit.2
    ##  0.7532427  -2.659        0  0.05 179.97 -1.973233 1.973233

below is another plot where I ran planned contrast. Again, this is
useful because published papers all have to show these statistics, so we
can visualize their power whenever we want.

``` r
power.f.test(ncp = 6.49, df1 = 1, df2 = 7257, alpha = 0.05, plot = TRUE)
```

    ##      power ncp.alt ncp.null alpha df1  df2   f.crit
